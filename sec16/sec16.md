# Introduction to Backend 

### You might remember that earlier in the course, when we deployed our first website (jump to lecture) you learned that we know how to build "Static Websites".

### Static websites are sites that consist of only HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

### Of course, the browser always receives just HTML, CSS & JavaScript - that's all the browser knows to parse and handle.

### BUT a website might need more than that to work correctly! Specifically, as you learned in the previous lecture, you might need server-side code in addition, to handle requests that contain data (e.g. form data) or to generate different HTML responses for different visitors.

### If you have a website that does require such server-side code in addition to the HTML, CSS & JavaScript instructions that might be sent to the browser, you have a so-called "Dynamic Website" (instead of a "Static Site").

### "Dynamic" because the generated HTML code is not always the same.
